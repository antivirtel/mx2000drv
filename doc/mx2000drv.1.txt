Description
-----------

*mx2000drv* is a configuration driver for the Perixx MX-2000 II Gaming Mouse. It allows the user to change mouse settings, button mappings, and macros.



Options
-------

*-h, --help*::
	Show syntax help and exit.

*-p, --profile*='PROFILE'::
	Target the active mouse profile, 'PROFILE', an integer between 1-4, inclusive. This option is only used for the *GET* and *SET* commands, and ignored for the *profile* setting inside those commands. If not provided, the current active profile is assumed.

*-v, --verbose*::
	Print extra debug information.

*-V, --version*::
	Print driver version and exit.



Commands
--------

Configuration Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

inspecting or changing mouse profile settings. Provide all arguments to change a setting to be that value. Leave off the final optional argument to retrieve the current value of that setting.

These commands require the *-p* option when used with any command except *profile*.


*profile* ['PROFILE']::
	The active mouse profile, an integer 1-4. The *-p* option is ignored for this setting.

*button* 'NUM' ['ASSIGNMENT']::
	Map the specified button number to perform 'ASSIGNMENT' when clicked. See *Button Numbers* for the assignment of mouse buttons to numbers.

*macro* 'NUM' ['SEQUENCE']::
	Map button to perform key 'SEQUENCE' when clicked. See *Button Numbers* for the assignment of mouse buttons to numbers.

*color* ['RGB']::
	Mouse backlight color as 6-character hexadecimal. Mostly. When breathe is enabled, each pair of hex characters also controls the fade cycle period of each LED color. So mixed values will end up with a bit of a color cycle between them. Compare 00FFFF with 0084FF

*breathe* ['ON'|'OFF']::
	Whether the mouse LEDs fade and pulse over time

*cycle* ['ON'|'OFF']::
	Cycle through the RGB combinations, including intermediates (yellow, cyan, magenta), only for the LEDs enabled by *color*. So FFFFFF will cycle through all colors and intermediates. 00FFFF will not show red, or magenta, but will show all others.

*lit* ['TIME']::
	Number of seconds the backlight is steady on when *breathe* is enabled. Min: 0, Max: 15

*dark* ['TIME']::
	Number of seconds the backlight is off when *breathe* is enabled. Min: 0, Max: 15

*pulse* ['TIME']::
	Number of seconds the backlight takes to transition from lit to dark, when *breathe* is enabled. Min: 0, Max: 63

*standby* ['TIME']::
	Enable backlight 'TIME' seconds after standby mode has come on. Min: 0, Max: 63

*backlight* ['ON'|'OFF']::
	Enable or disable the backlight mouse LEDs

*sensitivity* 'X'|'Y' ['VALUE']::
	The pointer sensitivity, a value between -5 and 5, inclusive.

*accel* ['SPEED']::
	The mouse acceleration in milliseconds. Min: 0, Max: 255.

*dpi* 'PRESET' ['VALUE']::
	Sets the resolution of a given DPI preset. 'PRESET' must be a number 1-4. 'VALUE' must be between 100 and 5600 in increments of 100

*dpiset* ['PRESET']::
	Sets or retrieves the active DPI preset (1-4).

*poll* ['RATE']::
	Mouse polling rate in Hz: 125, 250, 500, 1000




RESET
~~~~~

Resets all mouse configurations, settings, macros, and profiles to factory default. Similar to a recovery mode.



DUMP|LOAD
~~~~~~~~~~~

Save or load the entire mouse configuration including all settings, macros, and profiles to or from a 'FILE'. *-* may be provided in place of a file name for stdin/stdout.

load 'FILE'


Button Numbers
--------------

*1* 'Left Click'::
	The primary mouse button, on the left side of the scroll wheel, along the DPI lights. 

*2* 'Right Click'::
	The secondary mouse button, on the right side of the scroll wheel. 

*3* 'Scroll Wheel'::
	When the scroll wheel is pressed down like a button.

*6* 'Up'::
	Directly behind the scroll wheel is a pair of buttons. This is the one closer to the wheel, pointing towards the *front* of the mouse.

*7* 'Down'::
	Directly behind the scroll wheel is a pair of buttons. This is the one farther from the wheel, pointing towards the *back* of the mouse.
