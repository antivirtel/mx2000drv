Options
-------

*-h, --help*::
	Show syntax help and exit.

*-p, --profile*='PROFILE'::
	Target the active mouse profile, 'PROFILE', an integer between 1-4, inclusive. This option is only used for the *GET* and *SET* commands, and ignored for the *profile* setting inside those commands. If not provided, the current active profile is assumed.

*-v, --verbose*::
	Print extra debug information.

*-V, --version*::
	Print driver version and exit.



Commands
--------

Configuration Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

inspecting or changing mouse profile settings. Provide all arguments to change a setting to be that value. Leave off the final optional argument to retrieve the current value of that setting.

These commands require the *-p* option when used with any command except *profile*.


*profile* ['PROFILE']::
	The active mouse profile, an integer 1-4. The *-p* option is ignored for this setting.

*button* 'BUTTON NUM' ['ASSIGNMENT']::
	Map the specified button number to perform 'ASSIGNMENT' when clicked.

*macro* 'BUTTON NUM' ['SEQUENCE']::
	Map button to perform key 'SEQUENCE' when clicked.

*color* ['RGB']::
	Mouse backlight color as 6-character hexadecimal. Mostly. When breathe is enabled, each pair of hex characters also controls the fade cycle period of each LED color. So mixed values will end up with a bit of a color cycle between them. Compare 00FFFF with 0084FF

*breathe* ['ON'|'OFF']::
	Whether the mouse LEDs fade and pulse over time

*cycle* ['ON'|'OFF']::
	Cycle through the RGB combinations, including intermediates (yellow, cyan, magenta), only for the LEDs enabled by *color*. So FFFFFF will cycle through all colors and intermediates. 00FFFF will not show red, or magenta, but will show all others.

*lit* ['TIME']::
	Number of seconds the backlight is steady on when *breathe* is enabled. Min: 0, Max: 15

*dark* ['TIME']::
	Number of seconds the backlight is off when *breathe* is enabled. Min: 0, Max: 15

*pulse* ['TIME']::
	Number of seconds the backlight takes to transition from lit to dark, when *breathe* is enabled.

*standby* ['TIME']::
	Enable backlight 'TIME' seconds after standby mode has come on.

*backlight* ['ON'|'OFF']::
	Enable or disable the backlight mouse LEDs

*sensitivity* 'X'|'Y' ['VALUE']::
	The pointer sensitivity, a value between -5 and 5, inclusive.

*accel* ['SPEED']::
	The mouse acceleration in milliseconds, between 2 and 255.

*dpi* 'PRESET' ['VALUE']::
	'PRESET' must be a number 1-4. 'VALUE' must be between 100 and 1600 in increments of 100

////
todo:
select/fetch an active dpi preset

////

*poll* ['RATE']::
	Mouse polling rate in Hz: 125, 250, 500, 1000
